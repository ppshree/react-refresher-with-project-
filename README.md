## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ppshree/react-refresher-with-project-.git
cd react-refresher-with-project-

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Start the Development Server
npm run dev


This will run the app at http://localhost:<port>

📂 Study Roadmap
📕 Core React Basics (1.5 Weeks)

Components (Functional vs Class)

Functional Components → modern approach with hooks.

Class Components → use render() and lifecycle methods.

Props & State

Props = read-only data from parent → child.

State = local component data with useState.

JSX Basics

Write HTML-like syntax inside JS.

Wrap in one parent element.

Use {} for expressions.

Conditional Rendering

Render different UI using ternary, &&, or if-else.

Lists & Keys

Use .map() to render lists.

Always use a unique key prop.

Forms (Controlled & Uncontrolled)

Controlled → managed by React state.

Uncontrolled → managed by DOM using useRef.

🛠 Practice Projects (Basics)

Blog UI

Show posts list with unique keys.

Add new post using a controlled form.

Class → Functional Conversion

Convert lifecycle methods to hooks.

📗 React Hooks (1.5 Weeks)

useState

Add state to functional components.

Example: Counter, Like button.

useEffect (with cleanup)

Side effects → API calls, timers, subscriptions.

Cleanup prevents memory leaks.

useRef

Access DOM directly.

Store previous values without re-render.

useMemo

Optimize expensive calculations.

Memoizes results until dependencies change.

useCallback

Memoizes functions to avoid unnecessary child re-renders.

useReducer

Alternative to useState for complex logic.

Example: Todo list, counters.

🛠 Practice Projects (Hooks)

Timer App

Start / Stop / Reset using useEffect.

Large List Optimization

Render 1000+ items.

Use useMemo & useCallback.
